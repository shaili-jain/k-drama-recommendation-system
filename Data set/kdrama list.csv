As a result, Yeon Seo now finds herself faced with one of life’s most difficult challenges: graduating from high school.

Trying desperately to ignore the siren call of Meo Roo’s blood, Yeon Seo takes it upon herself to protect her classmate from those who hunt him. 

As Yeon Seo and Meo Roo run for their lives, the blood in his veins calls to her. Torn between family duty and the desires of her own heart, a war within Yeon Seo rages. Will she be able to embrace her humanity and resist the temptation of this boy’s sweet blood or will her vampire side rise victorious in the end?

The only obstacle to the scheme is Kim MinChul, a skeptical outcast who accidentally discovers evidence of Choi's past misdeeds and suddenly finds himself becoming the center of resistance against the church institution.

The female lead, Joo Seo Yeon, is a hot-tempered physical education high school teacher who always wears sneakers, jeans and training uniforms.The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is “not handsome.” 

In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.

Sparks fly when they meet and struggle to overcome their biases for and against people with flaws. Throughout the drama they learn to see beyond appearances to the tragic backstories and scars that motivate themselves and the people around them.
